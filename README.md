# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This project is the final project for a Coursera course named as Getting and Cleaning Data.

This page explains how the script works as well as how it connects with other files in the repo

## Project Goal

This project has following goals to accomplish:

1. Prepare a tidy dataset. 
2. A link to a Github repository with script for performing the analysis. 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.



## Script Goal

Particularly, the R script proided should achieve following goals:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.	

And please see comments in the script for how each requirement is met.
